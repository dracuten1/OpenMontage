# Publish Director - Localization Dub Pipeline

**REQUIRED owner delivery contract:** Read `/Users/tuyennguyen/.hermes/skills/media/video-producer/SKILL.md`, section **Thumbnail-as-Scene-1 Contract (SSOT)**. Thumbnail KHÔNG gửi file riêng nữa, mà được thiết kế trực tiếp làm Scene 1 (Thumbnail Card + Hook) của video (frame đầu t=0 làm poster cover, kèm lời đọc hook), sau đó mới tới nội dung chi tiết. Gói bàn giao chỉ gồm: Video (draft HUD / final sạch) + Copyable description (không gửi thumbnail riêng). Preserve approval gates and manual upload, no auto-post.

## When To Use

Package the completed localization outputs so downstream teams can find the right video, subtitle, and metadata bundle for each language without manual cleanup.

## Process

### 1. Package By Locale

Each language package should clearly separate:

- video output,
- subtitle files,
- transcript or approved script copy,
- review notes,
- metadata.

### 2. Keep Naming Precise

Recommended metadata keys:

- `locale`
- `language_name`
- `deliverable_mode`
- `subtitle_included`
- `review_owner`

### 3. Preserve Review Context

If a language output has pronunciation caveats, timing warnings, or missing lip sync, keep that note in the published package.

### 4. Quality Gate

- locale packages are clearly labeled,
- metadata matches the actual treatment,
- supporting text assets are present,
- warnings and review notes are not lost.

## Common Pitfalls

- Shipping localized videos without the matching subtitle or transcript files.
- Mixing audio-dub and subtitle-only variants under the same generic filename.
- Removing the QA notes that explain known issues.

## Gate Reminder (Binding)

This stage gates on human approval (`human_approval_default: true`). After review passes:
checkpoint with `status="awaiting_human"`, present the summary (the Backlot board renders
the artifact), and **END YOUR TURN**. Do not start the next stage in the same response.
Approval is per-gate — an earlier "go ahead" does not cover this gate.

## Production Contract Binding (docs/ORCHESTRATION_DOCTRINE.md)

The canonical production contract is `docs/ORCHESTRATION_DOCTRINE.md` (ENS primary authority; this skill is a synced, subordinate reference — doctrine wins on conflict). This pipeline's manifest stages (`pipeline_defs/<pipeline>.yaml`) map the contract's 7 required phases — brief/script/facts; actual audio + alignment; sealed scene packets; scene author/review; integration; final render/mix review; delivery. Domain-specific phases (rig, localization, research, capture) are additive and never bypass the contract.

Applicable mechanical gates (commands verified in-repo; per the doctrine honesty matrix, do NOT cite a gate as enforced for a production that does not use it — state "not applicable" instead):

- Edit→compose timing re-lock (narrated cuts): `.venv/bin/python -c "from tools.qc.timing_relock_guard import check_project_timing; check_project_timing('<project_dir>', mode='strict')"` — enforced at the checkpoint edit gate in `lib/checkpoint.py`; applies when `edit_decisions.cuts` contain narrated cuts backed by narration audio.
- Production validation (compose/publish checkpoint gate): `lib/production_validation.py` runs at every `compose`/`publish` checkpoint write via `validate_checkpoint_production_gate`; strict mode is the default for new production, and the 5 evidence gates (layout, timing-audio, semantic-events, sfx-mix, provenance-freshness) must carry real detector measurements.
- Remotion layout/events validators (when this pipeline renders via Remotion): `npm run validate:layout -- <spec>` and `npm run validate:events -- <spec>` inside `remotion-composer/`.
- Mix validation (when a mix profile + stems exist): `.venv/bin/python -m tools.qc.mix_validator <stems_dir> <mix_profile.json>` — fail-closed on undeclared missing stems; intentionally absent BGM/SFX must be explicitly declared, never silently unmeasured.
- Scene-packet workflow (only when this production uses scene packets / `scene_manifest.json`): `.venv/bin/python tools/qc/scene_orchestrator.py <episode_dir> --runner subprocess --max-concurrency 2 --max-retries 1 --scenes id1,id2 --evidence-file artifacts/scene_workflow_evidence.json`, then `.venv/bin/python tools/qc/episode_gate.py <episode_root>`. Runner honesty: subprocess is verified deterministic; daemon is experimental for reviewer turns.

Strict success semantics (doctrine §8.2): completion claims are valid only with applicable gate identities, the exact scene/cut set, stage scope, existing evidence files, bound revisions, and detector measurements. `revise`, `blocked`, missing evidence, or required `not_measured` can NEVER become completion; a mechanical gate failure is `blocked`, never "PASS WITH WARNINGS". Dependency freeze (§8.3): any mutation of frozen inputs invalidates dependent verdicts and renders — re-review/re-render, never reuse stale verdicts; after re-TTS run `tools/audio/refresh_manifest.py` and re-lock cuts. Legacy compat (§8.4): a historical/legacy mode (explicitly declared `validation_mode="legacy"`) can never silently authorize new production — strict is the default. Publication separation (§8.4): render acceptance (QC PASS) authorizes nothing beyond the accepted render; publish/delivery requires its own explicit owner authorization.

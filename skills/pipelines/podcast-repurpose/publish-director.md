# Publish Director - Podcast Repurpose Pipeline

**REQUIRED owner delivery contract:** Read `/Users/tuyennguyen/.hermes/skills/media/video-producer/SKILL.md`, section **Thumbnail-as-Scene-1 Contract (SSOT)**. Thumbnail KHÔNG gửi file riêng nữa, mà được thiết kế trực tiếp làm Scene 1 (Thumbnail Card + Hook) của video (frame đầu t=0 làm poster cover, kèm lời đọc hook), sau đó mới tới nội dung chi tiết. Gói bàn giao chỉ gồm: Video (draft HUD / final sạch) + Copyable description (không gửi thumbnail riêng). Preserve approval gates and manual upload, no auto-post.

## When To Use

Package podcast-derived clips and companion assets so that every short-form piece points back to the episode instead of drifting as an isolated fragment.

## Prerequisites

| Layer | Resource | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Schema | `schemas/artifacts/publish_log.schema.json` | Artifact validation |
| Prior artifacts | `state.artifacts["compose"]["render_report"]`, `state.artifacts["idea"]["brief"]`, `state.artifacts["script"]["script"]` | Outputs, source truth, chapters |
| Playbook | Active style playbook | Brand voice |

## Process

### 1. Link Every Clip Back To The Episode

Each short-form asset should reference:

- show name,
- episode title or number,
- guest name where relevant,
- full episode destination.

### 2. Tailor The Copy

- Shorts / Reels / TikTok: hook-led and concise
- LinkedIn: insight-led and more contextual
- YouTube companion: chapter-rich and search-friendly

### 3. Sequence The Release

Recommended order:

1. strongest announcement clip
2. next-best insight clip
3. quote-led or guest-led follow-ups
4. remaining supporting clips

### 4. Store Cross-Linking Truth In Metadata

Recommended metadata keys:

- `episode_reference`
- `guest_tags`
- `posting_schedule`
- `clip_to_episode_map`

### 5. Quality Gate

- every clip points back to the episode,
- guest attribution is correct,
- copy matches the platform,
- the release order reflects actual clip strength.

## Common Pitfalls

- Publishing clips without clear episode references.
- Forgetting to tag or mention the guest when that audience matters.
- Reusing one caption style across every platform.

## Gate Reminder (Binding)

This stage gates on human approval (`human_approval_default: true`). After review passes:
checkpoint with `status="awaiting_human"`, present the summary (the Backlot board renders
the artifact), and **END YOUR TURN**. Do not start the next stage in the same response.
Approval is per-gate — an earlier "go ahead" does not cover this gate.

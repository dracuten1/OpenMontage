# Publish Director - Cinematic Pipeline

**REQUIRED owner delivery contract:** Read `/Users/tuyennguyen/.hermes/skills/media/video-producer/SKILL.md`, section **Thumbnail-as-Scene-1 Contract (SSOT)**. Thumbnail KHÔNG gửi file riêng nữa, mà được thiết kế trực tiếp làm Scene 1 (Thumbnail Card + Hook) của video (frame đầu t=0 làm poster cover, kèm lời đọc hook), sau đó mới tới nội dung chi tiết. Gói bàn giao chỉ gồm: Video (draft HUD / final sạch) + Copyable description (không gửi thumbnail riêng). Preserve approval gates and manual upload, no auto-post.

## When To Use

Package the cinematic piece and any cutdowns so the hero version stays clear and the distribution intent is obvious.

## Prerequisites

| Layer | Resource | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Schema | `schemas/artifacts/publish_log.schema.json` | Artifact validation |
| Prior artifacts | `state.artifacts["compose"]["render_report"]`, `state.artifacts["proposal"]["proposal_packet"]`, `state.artifacts["research"]["research_brief"]`, `state.artifacts["script"]["script"]` | Final outputs and beat map |
| Playbook | Active style playbook | Tone and naming consistency |

## Process

### 1. Separate Hero And Derivatives

Typical deliverables:

- hero trailer or brand film,
- teaser cut,
- social cutdown,
- poster-frame or thumbnail concept.

### 2. Match Metadata To Tone

Packaging should reflect the actual mood:

- dramatic,
- premium,
- mysterious,
- reflective,
- urgent.

### 3. Preserve Editorial Truth

Store in `publish_log.metadata`:

- `hero_output`
- `derivative_outputs`
- `poster_frame_notes`
- `distribution_notes`

### 4. Quality Gate

- hero export is clearly identified,
- derivative exports are labeled by purpose,
- metadata fits the tone,
- the package is usable without manual cleanup.

## Common Pitfalls

- Mixing teaser and hero outputs without clear naming.
- Writing generic metadata that ignores the mood.
- Treating all cutdowns as interchangeable.

## Gate Reminder (Binding)

This stage gates on human approval (`human_approval_default: true`). After review passes:
checkpoint with `status="awaiting_human"`, present the summary (the Backlot board renders
the artifact), and **END YOUR TURN**. Do not start the next stage in the same response.
Approval is per-gate — an earlier "go ahead" does not cover this gate.

## Production Contract Binding (docs/ORCHESTRATION_DOCTRINE.md)

The canonical production contract is `docs/ORCHESTRATION_DOCTRINE.md` (ENS primary authority; this skill is a synced, subordinate reference — doctrine wins on conflict). This pipeline's manifest stages (`pipeline_defs/<pipeline>.yaml`) map the contract's 7 required phases — brief/script/facts; actual audio + alignment; sealed scene packets; scene author/review; integration; final render/mix review; delivery. Domain-specific phases (rig, localization, research, capture) are additive and never bypass the contract.

Applicable mechanical gates (commands verified in-repo; per the doctrine honesty matrix, do NOT cite a gate as enforced for a production that does not use it — state "not applicable" instead):

- Edit→compose timing re-lock (narrated cuts): `.venv/bin/python -c "from tools.qc.timing_relock_guard import check_project_timing; check_project_timing('<project_dir>', mode='strict')"` — enforced at the checkpoint edit gate in `lib/checkpoint.py`; applies when `edit_decisions.cuts` contain narrated cuts backed by narration audio.
- Production validation (compose/publish checkpoint gate): `lib/production_validation.py` runs at every `compose`/`publish` checkpoint write via `validate_checkpoint_production_gate`; strict mode is the default for new production, and the 5 evidence gates (layout, timing-audio, semantic-events, sfx-mix, provenance-freshness) must carry real detector measurements.
- Remotion layout/events validators (when this pipeline renders via Remotion): `npm run validate:layout -- <spec>` and `npm run validate:events -- <spec>` inside `remotion-composer/`.
- Mix validation (when a mix profile + stems exist): `.venv/bin/python -m tools.qc.mix_validator <stems_dir> <mix_profile.json>` — fail-closed on undeclared missing stems; intentionally absent BGM/SFX must be explicitly declared, never silently unmeasured.
- Scene-packet workflow (only when this production uses scene packets / `scene_manifest.json`): `.venv/bin/python tools/qc/scene_orchestrator.py <episode_dir> --runner subprocess --max-concurrency 2 --max-retries 1 --scenes id1,id2 --evidence-file artifacts/scene_workflow_evidence.json`, then `.venv/bin/python tools/qc/episode_gate.py <episode_root>`. Runner honesty: subprocess is verified deterministic; daemon is experimental for reviewer turns.

Strict success semantics (doctrine §8.2): completion claims are valid only with applicable gate identities, the exact scene/cut set, stage scope, existing evidence files, bound revisions, and detector measurements. `revise`, `blocked`, missing evidence, or required `not_measured` can NEVER become completion; a mechanical gate failure is `blocked`, never "PASS WITH WARNINGS". Dependency freeze (§8.3): any mutation of frozen inputs invalidates dependent verdicts and renders — re-review/re-render, never reuse stale verdicts; after re-TTS run `tools/audio/refresh_manifest.py` and re-lock cuts. Legacy compat (§8.4): a historical/legacy mode (explicitly declared `validation_mode="legacy"`) can never silently authorize new production — strict is the default. Publication separation (§8.4): render acceptance (QC PASS) authorizes nothing beyond the accepted render; publish/delivery requires its own explicit owner authorization.

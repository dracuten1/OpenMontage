# Proposal Director - Character Animation Pipeline

## Goal

Present character-animation concepts that are honest about local rigged motion,
reuse, cost, and runtime choice.

## Required Proposal Elements

Each option must include:

- characters and roles,
- visual style,
- action complexity,
- rig reuse strategy,
- sample plan,
- audio architecture,
- music plan,
- render runtime options,
- cost estimate,
- honest limitation note.

## Runtime Selection

Read `skills/meta/animation-runtime-selector.md` before recommending a runtime.

When both Remotion and HyperFrames are available:

- Remotion: best when the final composition needs deterministic React-rendered
  video, captions, audio, scene JSON, and final MP4 governance.
- HyperFrames: best when the character scene is HTML/SVG/GSAP-heavy and benefits
  from web-native authoring, lint, validate, and registry blocks.
- FFmpeg: post-processing only. Do not pick FFmpeg as the primary runtime for
  character acting.

Present both Remotion and HyperFrames to the user before recommending one.
Record the alternatives considered in the decision log as
`render_runtime_selection`, including why `hyperframes` was accepted or rejected.
Wait for user approval before locking `render_runtime`.

## Sample-First Rule

Before full production, propose a 10-15 second sample containing:

- one main character,
- one expression change,
- one body action,
- one camera/background treatment,
- one audio/music cue if relevant.

Do not batch-generate all assets until this sample is approved.

## Cost Honesty

Local rigging is cheap at render time but expensive in authoring complexity.
Report the difference:

- asset generation cost,
- TTS/music cost,
- local render cost,
- manual complexity risk.

## Gate Reminder (Binding)

This stage gates on human approval (`human_approval_default: true`). After review passes:
checkpoint with `status="awaiting_human"`, present the summary (the Backlot board renders
the artifact), and **END YOUR TURN**. Do not start the next stage in the same response.
Approval is per-gate — an earlier "go ahead" does not cover this gate.

## Production Contract Binding (docs/ORCHESTRATION_DOCTRINE.md)

The canonical production contract is `docs/ORCHESTRATION_DOCTRINE.md` (ENS primary authority; this skill is a synced, subordinate reference — doctrine wins on conflict). This pipeline's manifest stages (`pipeline_defs/<pipeline>.yaml`) map the contract's 7 required phases — brief/script/facts; actual audio + alignment; sealed scene packets; scene author/review; integration; final render/mix review; delivery. Domain-specific phases (rig, localization, research, capture) are additive and never bypass the contract.

Applicable mechanical gates (commands verified in-repo; per the doctrine honesty matrix, do NOT cite a gate as enforced for a production that does not use it — state "not applicable" instead):

- Edit→compose timing re-lock (narrated cuts): `.venv/bin/python -c "from tools.qc.timing_relock_guard import check_project_timing; check_project_timing('<project_dir>', mode='strict')"` — enforced at the checkpoint edit gate in `lib/checkpoint.py`; applies when `edit_decisions.cuts` contain narrated cuts backed by narration audio.
- Production validation (compose/publish checkpoint gate): `lib/production_validation.py` runs at every `compose`/`publish` checkpoint write via `validate_checkpoint_production_gate`; strict mode is the default for new production, and the 5 evidence gates (layout, timing-audio, semantic-events, sfx-mix, provenance-freshness) must carry real detector measurements.
- Remotion layout/events validators (when this pipeline renders via Remotion): `npm run validate:layout -- <spec>` and `npm run validate:events -- <spec>` inside `remotion-composer/`.
- Mix validation (when a mix profile + stems exist): `.venv/bin/python -m tools.qc.mix_validator <stems_dir> <mix_profile.json>` — fail-closed on undeclared missing stems; intentionally absent BGM/SFX must be explicitly declared, never silently unmeasured.
- Scene-packet workflow (only when this production uses scene packets / `scene_manifest.json`): `.venv/bin/python tools/qc/scene_orchestrator.py <episode_dir> --runner subprocess --max-concurrency 2 --max-retries 1 --scenes id1,id2 --evidence-file artifacts/scene_workflow_evidence.json`, then `.venv/bin/python tools/qc/episode_gate.py <episode_root>`. Runner honesty: subprocess is verified deterministic; daemon is experimental for reviewer turns.

Strict success semantics (doctrine §8.2): completion claims are valid only with applicable gate identities, the exact scene/cut set, stage scope, existing evidence files, bound revisions, and detector measurements. `revise`, `blocked`, missing evidence, or required `not_measured` can NEVER become completion; a mechanical gate failure is `blocked`, never "PASS WITH WARNINGS". Dependency freeze (§8.3): any mutation of frozen inputs invalidates dependent verdicts and renders — re-review/re-render, never reuse stale verdicts; after re-TTS run `tools/audio/refresh_manifest.py` and re-lock cuts. Legacy compat (§8.4): a historical/legacy mode (explicitly declared `validation_mode="legacy"`) can never silently authorize new production — strict is the default. Publication separation (§8.4): render acceptance (QC PASS) authorizes nothing beyond the accepted render; publish/delivery requires its own explicit owner authorization.

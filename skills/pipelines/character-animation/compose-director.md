# Compose Director - Character Animation Pipeline

## Goal

Render the approved character animation and prove it was reviewed.

## Runtime Routing

First read `edit_decisions.render_runtime`. It must match the runtime locked in
proposal unless a `render_runtime_selection` decision explicitly changed it.

- `remotion`: stage assets into `remotion-composer/public`, build composition
  JSON, render via `video_compose`.
- `hyperframes`: materialize a HyperFrames workspace and let `video_compose`
  delegate to `hyperframes_compose`. `hyperframes lint` and `validate` must pass.
- `ffmpeg`: only for post-processing or simple video assembly; not enough for
  character acting by itself.

## Review Workflow

1. Run `character_rig_renderer` to produce or refresh the HyperFrames package.
   The browser preview is a QA/debug artifact only, not the render path.
2. Verify the renderer emitted a HyperFrames `workspace_path`, composition HTML,
   `asset_manifest`, and `edit_decisions.render_runtime: "hyperframes"` handoff.
3. Run `character_animation_reviewer` against rig, poses, timeline, and preview.
4. Render final video through `video_compose` using the renderer handoff or the
   approved Remotion/HyperFrames package. The deliverable path is
   `projects/<project-name>/renders/final.mp4`, matching the standard
   OpenMontage project convention.
5. Run standard `final_review`: ffprobe, frame sampling, visual spotcheck, audio
   spotcheck, promise preservation.

## Browser QA

When Playwright is available:

- open the preview,
- capture opening/middle/end frames,
- check for console errors,
- verify characters are visible,
- compare frame deltas to ensure motion exists.

When Playwright is unavailable, use static artifact checks and FFmpeg frame
sampling, and report the reduced confidence.

## Quality Bar

Do not present the output as complete when `character_qa_report.status` is
`revise` or `fail`.

## Production Contract Binding (docs/ORCHESTRATION_DOCTRINE.md)

The canonical production contract is `docs/ORCHESTRATION_DOCTRINE.md` (ENS primary authority; this skill is a synced, subordinate reference — doctrine wins on conflict). This pipeline's manifest stages (`pipeline_defs/<pipeline>.yaml`) map the contract's 7 required phases — brief/script/facts; actual audio + alignment; sealed scene packets; scene author/review; integration; final render/mix review; delivery. Domain-specific phases (rig, localization, research, capture) are additive and never bypass the contract.

Applicable mechanical gates (commands verified in-repo; per the doctrine honesty matrix, do NOT cite a gate as enforced for a production that does not use it — state "not applicable" instead):

- Edit→compose timing re-lock (narrated cuts): `.venv/bin/python -c "from tools.qc.timing_relock_guard import check_project_timing; check_project_timing('<project_dir>', mode='strict')"` — enforced at the checkpoint edit gate in `lib/checkpoint.py`; applies when `edit_decisions.cuts` contain narrated cuts backed by narration audio.
- Production validation (compose/publish checkpoint gate): `lib/production_validation.py` runs at every `compose`/`publish` checkpoint write via `validate_checkpoint_production_gate`; strict mode is the default for new production, and the 5 evidence gates (layout, timing-audio, semantic-events, sfx-mix, provenance-freshness) must carry real detector measurements.
- Remotion layout/events validators (when this pipeline renders via Remotion): `npm run validate:layout -- <spec>` and `npm run validate:events -- <spec>` inside `remotion-composer/`.
- Mix validation (when a mix profile + stems exist): `.venv/bin/python -m tools.qc.mix_validator <stems_dir> <mix_profile.json>` — fail-closed on undeclared missing stems; intentionally absent BGM/SFX must be explicitly declared, never silently unmeasured.
- Scene-packet workflow (only when this production uses scene packets / `scene_manifest.json`): `.venv/bin/python tools/qc/scene_orchestrator.py <episode_dir> --runner subprocess --max-concurrency 2 --max-retries 1 --scenes id1,id2 --evidence-file artifacts/scene_workflow_evidence.json`, then `.venv/bin/python tools/qc/episode_gate.py <episode_root>`. Runner honesty: subprocess is verified deterministic; daemon is experimental for reviewer turns.

Strict success semantics (doctrine §8.2): completion claims are valid only with applicable gate identities, the exact scene/cut set, stage scope, existing evidence files, bound revisions, and detector measurements. `revise`, `blocked`, missing evidence, or required `not_measured` can NEVER become completion; a mechanical gate failure is `blocked`, never "PASS WITH WARNINGS". Dependency freeze (§8.3): any mutation of frozen inputs invalidates dependent verdicts and renders — re-review/re-render, never reuse stale verdicts; after re-TTS run `tools/audio/refresh_manifest.py` and re-lock cuts. Legacy compat (§8.4): a historical/legacy mode (explicitly declared `validation_mode="legacy"`) can never silently authorize new production — strict is the default. Publication separation (§8.4): render acceptance (QC PASS) authorizes nothing beyond the accepted render; publish/delivery requires its own explicit owner authorization.

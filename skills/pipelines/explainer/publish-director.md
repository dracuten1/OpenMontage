# Publish Director — Explainer Pipeline

**REQUIRED owner delivery contract:** Read `/Users/tuyennguyen/.hermes/skills/media/video-producer/SKILL.md`, section **Thumbnail-as-Scene-1 Contract (SSOT)**. Thumbnail KHÔNG gửi file riêng nữa, mà được thiết kế trực tiếp làm Scene 1 (Thumbnail Card + Hook) của video (frame đầu t=0 làm poster cover, kèm lời đọc hook), sau đó mới tới nội dung chi tiết. Gói bàn giao chỉ gồm: Video (draft HUD / final sạch) + Copyable description (không gửi thumbnail riêng). Preserve approval gates and manual upload, no auto-post.

## When to Use

You are the Publisher for a generated explainer video. You have a `render_report` with the final video file. Your job is to prepare the video for distribution: generate SEO metadata, create thumbnails, package exports, and log the publish event.

This is where a great video reaches its audience. Without proper metadata and packaging, even the best content gets buried.

## Prerequisites

| Layer | Resource | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Schema | `schemas/artifacts/publish_log.schema.json` | Artifact validation |
| Prior artifacts | `state.artifacts["compose"]["render_report"]`, `state.artifacts["proposal"]["proposal_packet"]`, `state.artifacts["research"]["research_brief"]` | Video file and original proposal |
| Playbook | Active style playbook | Visual style for thumbnail |

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Context

Collect everything needed for metadata:
- **Proposal packet**: title, hook, key points, target platform, tone
- **Render report**: output path, duration, resolution
- **Script**: section summaries for description/chapters

### Step 2: Generate SEO Metadata

**Title** (max 60 characters for YouTube):
- Include the primary keyword from the proposal packet
- Lead with a hook or number
- Avoid clickbait but be compelling
- Examples: "Vector Databases Explained in 60 Seconds" > "About Vector Databases"

**Description** (first 150 chars are critical — shown in search):
- Opening line: restate the hook with the main value proposition
- Body: key topics covered, with relevant keywords naturally included
- Chapters: timestamp markers for each major section (from script sections)
- Call to action: subscribe/like/follow
- Links: relevant resources mentioned in the video

**Tags/Keywords** (platform-dependent):
- 5-10 specific tags derived from proposal packet's key_points
- Mix broad and specific: "machine learning" + "vector database tutorial"
- Include the topic, format ("explainer"), and related terms

**Hashtags** (for social platforms):
- 3-5 relevant hashtags
- Mix trending and niche

### Step 3: Generate Thumbnail Concept

Describe a thumbnail that:
1. Uses the playbook's visual style
2. Features the video's core concept visually
3. Includes 3-5 words of text (the hook or key stat)
4. Has high contrast and is readable at small sizes
5. Uses the playbook's accent colors for text

```json
{
  "thumbnail": {
    "concept": "Split screen: left side shows slow SQL query (red X), right shows fast vector search (green check). Large text: '100x FASTER'",
    "text_overlay": "100x FASTER",
    "style_notes": "Use playbook accent colors, bold Inter font, dark background"
  }
}
```

*Note: Actual thumbnail generation happens via image_selector if available, otherwise it's a concept for manual creation.*

### Step 4: Create Chapter Markers

From the script sections, generate YouTube-style chapters:

```
0:00 - Introduction
0:15 - What are Vector Databases?
0:45 - How Embeddings Work
1:20 - The Search Algorithm
1:55 - Real-World Examples
2:30 - When to Use Vector DBs
```

Each chapter maps to a script section's `start_seconds`.

### Step 5: Package Export

Use the `export_bundle` tool (capability `publish`) to do the packaging
deterministically — pass it the final `video_path` (from `render_report`), the
`title`, and the metadata you prepared (`description`, `tags`, `hashtags`,
`chapters`, optional `subtitles_path` and `thumbnail_path`/`thumbnail_concept`).
It lays out the export directory, writes the metadata files, and returns a
schema-valid `publish_log` (`status: "exported"`) in `data["publish_log"]` that
you persist as the stage artifact.

It produces this structure:

```
exports/
  <project_name>/
    video/
      output.mp4            # Final rendered video (subtitles.srt alongside if provided)
    metadata/
      metadata.json         # All SEO metadata
      chapters.txt          # Chapter markers
      description.txt       # Ready-to-paste description (+ chapters)
      tags.txt              # One tag per line
    thumbnails/
      concept.json          # Thumbnail concept (or the copied thumbnail image)
```

`export_bundle` is a local, offline packager — it does not upload. A networked
publisher (e.g. a YouTube uploader) would be a separate `publish`-capability
provider.

### Step 6: Build Publish Log

`export_bundle` already returns a schema-valid `publish_log` in `data["publish_log"]` — persist that directly rather than hand-building one. Do **not** add extra entry fields (the schema sets `additionalProperties: false`; only `platform`, `status`, `url`, `video_id`, `visibility`, `export_path`, `timestamp`, `metadata_used`, `error` are allowed). The shape it returns:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "entries": [
    {
      "platform": "youtube",
      "status": "exported",
      "export_path": "projects/vector-db-explainer/exports",
      "timestamp": "2026-01-15T10:30:00+00:00",
      "metadata_used": {
        "title": "Vector Databases Explained in 60 Seconds",
        "description": "What vector databases are and when to use them.",
        "hashtags": ["#ai", "#vectordb"],
        "chapters": [{ "start_seconds": 0, "title": "Introduction" }]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 7: Self-Evaluate

Score (1-5):

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **SEO quality** | Would this title and description rank well for the topic? |
| **Description completeness** | Does the description include chapters, CTA, and keywords? |
| **Thumbnail concept** | Would this thumbnail stand out in a feed? |
| **Export package** | Is everything a creator needs in the export directory? |
| **Platform fit** | Is metadata tailored to the target platform? |

If any dimension scores below 3, revise.

### Step 8: Submit

Validate the publish_log against the schema and persist via checkpoint.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Generic titles**: "Video About X" loses to "X Explained in 60 Seconds" every time. Be specific and compelling.
- **No chapters**: YouTube rewards videos with chapters. Always include them.
- **Description keyword stuffing**: Write for humans first, search engines second. Natural language with keywords woven in.
- **Forgetting the CTA**: Every description should end with a call to action.
- **Wrong platform format**: YouTube descriptions differ from TikTok captions. Tailor to the target platform.

## Gate Reminder (Binding)

This stage gates on human approval (`human_approval_default: true`). After review passes:
checkpoint with `status="awaiting_human"`, present the summary (the Backlot board renders
the artifact), and **END YOUR TURN**. Do not start the next stage in the same response.
Approval is per-gate — an earlier "go ahead" does not cover this gate.

## Production Contract Binding (docs/ORCHESTRATION_DOCTRINE.md)

The canonical production contract is `docs/ORCHESTRATION_DOCTRINE.md` (ENS primary authority; this skill is a synced, subordinate reference — doctrine wins on conflict). This pipeline's manifest stages (`pipeline_defs/<pipeline>.yaml`) map the contract's 7 required phases — brief/script/facts; actual audio + alignment; sealed scene packets; scene author/review; integration; final render/mix review; delivery. Domain-specific phases (rig, localization, research, capture) are additive and never bypass the contract.

Applicable mechanical gates (commands verified in-repo; per the doctrine honesty matrix, do NOT cite a gate as enforced for a production that does not use it — state "not applicable" instead):

- Edit→compose timing re-lock (narrated cuts): `.venv/bin/python -c "from tools.qc.timing_relock_guard import check_project_timing; check_project_timing('<project_dir>', mode='strict')"` — enforced at the checkpoint edit gate in `lib/checkpoint.py`; applies when `edit_decisions.cuts` contain narrated cuts backed by narration audio.
- Production validation (compose/publish checkpoint gate): `lib/production_validation.py` runs at every `compose`/`publish` checkpoint write via `validate_checkpoint_production_gate`; strict mode is the default for new production, and the 5 evidence gates (layout, timing-audio, semantic-events, sfx-mix, provenance-freshness) must carry real detector measurements.
- Remotion layout/events validators (when this pipeline renders via Remotion): `npm run validate:layout -- <spec>` and `npm run validate:events -- <spec>` inside `remotion-composer/`.
- Mix validation (when a mix profile + stems exist): `.venv/bin/python -m tools.qc.mix_validator <stems_dir> <mix_profile.json>` — fail-closed on undeclared missing stems; intentionally absent BGM/SFX must be explicitly declared, never silently unmeasured.
- Scene-packet workflow (only when this production uses scene packets / `scene_manifest.json`): `.venv/bin/python tools/qc/scene_orchestrator.py <episode_dir> --runner subprocess --max-concurrency 2 --max-retries 1 --scenes id1,id2 --evidence-file artifacts/scene_workflow_evidence.json`, then `.venv/bin/python tools/qc/episode_gate.py <episode_root>`. Runner honesty: subprocess is verified deterministic; daemon is experimental for reviewer turns.

Strict success semantics (doctrine §8.2): completion claims are valid only with applicable gate identities, the exact scene/cut set, stage scope, existing evidence files, bound revisions, and detector measurements. `revise`, `blocked`, missing evidence, or required `not_measured` can NEVER become completion; a mechanical gate failure is `blocked`, never "PASS WITH WARNINGS". Dependency freeze (§8.3): any mutation of frozen inputs invalidates dependent verdicts and renders — re-review/re-render, never reuse stale verdicts; after re-TTS run `tools/audio/refresh_manifest.py` and re-lock cuts. Legacy compat (§8.4): a historical/legacy mode (explicitly declared `validation_mode="legacy"`) can never silently authorize new production — strict is the default. Publication separation (§8.4): render acceptance (QC PASS) authorizes nothing beyond the accepted render; publish/delivery requires its own explicit owner authorization.

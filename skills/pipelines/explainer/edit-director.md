# Edit Director — Explainer Pipeline

## When to Use

You are the Editor for a generated explainer video. You have an `asset_manifest` with all generated files, a `scene_plan` with visual structure, and a `script` with timing. Your job is to assemble the edit decision list (EDL): what plays when, how elements layer, where subtitles go, and how music and narration interact.

This is where raw assets become a coherent video. Good editing makes average assets shine; bad editing wastes great assets.

## Prerequisites

| Layer | Resource | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Schema | `schemas/artifacts/edit_decisions.schema.json` | Artifact validation |
| Prior artifacts | `state.artifacts["assets"]["asset_manifest"]`, `state.artifacts["scene_plan"]["scene_plan"]`, `state.artifacts["script"]["script"]` | Assets, visual plan, timing |
| Playbook | Active style playbook | Transitions, pacing rules, overlay styles |

## Process

### Step 1: Map Assets to Timeline

For each scene in the scene plan:
1. Find the matching assets from the asset manifest (by `scene_id`)
2. Find the matching narration audio (by script section)
3. Note the scene's timing (`start_seconds`, `end_seconds`)

Build a timeline map:
```
0s-10s: scene-1 (talking_head) | narration-s1 | img-intro.png
10s-18s: scene-2 (diagram) | narration-s2 | diagram-flow.svg
18s-22s: scene-3 (text_card) | narration-s3 | [text overlay]
...
```

### Step 2: Define Cuts

Each cut defines what visual is shown and when:

```json
{
  "id": "cut-1",
  "source": "img-scene-1",
  "in_seconds": 0,
  "out_seconds": 10,
  "layer": "primary",
  "transform": {
    "scale": 1.0,
    "position": "center",
    "animation": "ken-burns-slow-zoom"
  },
  "transition_in": "fade",
  "transition_out": "dissolve",
  "transition_duration": 0.4
}
```

**Layering rules:**
- `primary` — main visual (one at a time)
- `overlay` — text cards, stat cards, key terms (on top of primary)
- `background` — solid color or texture behind everything

### Step 3: Configure Subtitles

Subtitles are mandatory for all explainer content:

```json
{
  "subtitles": {
    "enabled": true,
    "style": "word-by-word",
    "font": "Inter",
    "font_size": 48,
    "color": "#FFFFFF",
    "background": "#00000088",
    "position": "bottom-center",
    "max_words_per_line": 8
  }
}
```

**Subtitle timing**: Derive from narration audio timestamps. Each word should highlight as it's spoken (word-by-word style) or display in phrase chunks (phrase style).

Use the playbook's typography for font choices.

### Step 4: Configure Audio Layers

```json
{
  "audio": {
    "narration": {
      "segments": [
        { "asset_id": "narration-s1", "start_seconds": 0 },
        { "asset_id": "narration-s2", "start_seconds": 10 }
      ]
    },
    "music": {
      "asset_id": "music-bg",
      "volume": 0.08,
      "fade_in_seconds": 2,
      "fade_out_seconds": 3,
      "ducking": {
        "enabled": true,
        "threshold_db": -3,
        "reduction_db": -8,
        "attack_ms": 200,
        "release_ms": 500
      }
    },
    "sfx": []
  }
}
```

**Music ducking**: Music volume drops when narration plays, rises during pauses. Use playbook's `audio.ducking_threshold_db`.

### Step 5: Apply Pacing Rules

Check the playbook's `motion.pacing_rules`:
- No cut shorter than `min_scene_hold_seconds`
- No cut longer than `max_scene_hold_seconds`
- Text cards hold for `text_card_hold_seconds`
- Transitions use `transition_duration_seconds`

Adjust cut timing if any violates these rules.

### Step 6: Verify Edit Completeness

**Timeline coverage:**
- [ ] Cuts span full video duration (no black frames)
- [ ] No overlapping primary cuts
- [ ] Every scene in scene_plan has at least one corresponding cut

**Asset references:**
- [ ] Every cut's `source` references a valid asset_id from the manifest
- [ ] Every narration segment references a valid audio asset
- [ ] Music asset exists

**Audio sync:**
- [ ] Narration segments are ordered and non-overlapping
- [ ] Narration timing aligns with corresponding visual cuts
- [ ] Music ducking is configured

**Subtitles:**
- [ ] Subtitles enabled
- [ ] Subtitle style uses playbook-compatible fonts and colors

### Step 7: Self-Evaluate

Score (1-5):

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Continuity** | Does every second of the video have a visual? |
| **Pacing** | Do cuts follow the playbook's timing rules? |
| **Audio-visual sync** | Does what you see match what you hear at every moment? |
| **Subtitle quality** | Are subtitles readable and correctly timed? |
| **Transition coherence** | Do transitions follow the playbook's allowed set? |

If any dimension scores below 3, revise.

### Step 8: Submit

Validate the edit_decisions artifact against the schema and persist via checkpoint.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Forgetting gaps**: If scene-1 ends at 10s and scene-2 starts at 10.5s, there's a 0.5s black frame. Check for gaps.
- **Audio drift (CRITICAL MECHANICAL ENFORCEMENT)**: Narration audio generated by TTS drifts from planned durations. NEVER lock cuts to planned scene_plan durations. Always lock visual cut boundaries to MEASURED audio durations from `asset_manifest.json` (or `narration_words.json` when present).
  - If re-TTS is run (e.g. after pronunciation corrections), you MUST run `.venv/bin/python tools/audio/refresh_manifest.py <manifest_path>` to re-probe actual durations.
  - The edit-to-compose stage gate in `lib/checkpoint.py` mechanically enforces this timing re-lock check (`validate_edit_timing_against_audio`). A desynced edit will HARD FAIL the checkpoint gate. Run: `.venv/bin/python -c "from tools.qc.timing_relock_guard import check_project_timing; check_project_timing('<dir>', mode='strict')"`
  - **Episode Gate Authority**: Cuts declared in `edit_decisions.cuts` form the authoritative scene set diffed by `.venv/bin/python tools/qc/episode_gate.py <episode_root>`. Every cut must match a valid, non-stale scene packet, and packet narration hashes must match current cut source audio hashes. Discrepancies trigger `scene_packet_missing`, `scene_packet_extra`, or `stale_packet`.
- **No ducking**: Music playing at full volume under narration makes the video unwatchable. Always configure ducking.
- **Same transition everywhere**: Varying transitions creates rhythm. Use the playbook's allowed set, but don't use the same one for every cut.
- **Subtitle font mismatch**: Subtitles should use the playbook's body font, not a random default.

## Production Contract Binding (docs/ORCHESTRATION_DOCTRINE.md)

The canonical production contract is `docs/ORCHESTRATION_DOCTRINE.md` (ENS primary authority; this skill is a synced, subordinate reference — doctrine wins on conflict). This pipeline's manifest stages (`pipeline_defs/<pipeline>.yaml`) map the contract's 7 required phases — brief/script/facts; actual audio + alignment; sealed scene packets; scene author/review; integration; final render/mix review; delivery. Domain-specific phases (rig, localization, research, capture) are additive and never bypass the contract.

Applicable mechanical gates (commands verified in-repo; per the doctrine honesty matrix, do NOT cite a gate as enforced for a production that does not use it — state "not applicable" instead):

- Edit→compose timing re-lock (narrated cuts): `.venv/bin/python -c "from tools.qc.timing_relock_guard import check_project_timing; check_project_timing('<project_dir>', mode='strict')"` — enforced at the checkpoint edit gate in `lib/checkpoint.py`; applies when `edit_decisions.cuts` contain narrated cuts backed by narration audio.
- Production validation (compose/publish checkpoint gate): `lib/production_validation.py` runs at every `compose`/`publish` checkpoint write via `validate_checkpoint_production_gate`; strict mode is the default for new production, and the 5 evidence gates (layout, timing-audio, semantic-events, sfx-mix, provenance-freshness) must carry real detector measurements.
- Remotion layout/events validators (when this pipeline renders via Remotion): `npm run validate:layout -- <spec>` and `npm run validate:events -- <spec>` inside `remotion-composer/`.
- Mix validation (when a mix profile + stems exist): `.venv/bin/python -m tools.qc.mix_validator <stems_dir> <mix_profile.json>` — fail-closed on undeclared missing stems; intentionally absent BGM/SFX must be explicitly declared, never silently unmeasured.
- Scene-packet workflow (only when this production uses scene packets / `scene_manifest.json`): `.venv/bin/python tools/qc/scene_orchestrator.py <episode_dir> --runner subprocess --max-concurrency 2 --max-retries 1 --scenes id1,id2 --evidence-file artifacts/scene_workflow_evidence.json`, then `.venv/bin/python tools/qc/episode_gate.py <episode_root>`. Runner honesty: subprocess is verified deterministic; daemon is experimental for reviewer turns.

Strict success semantics (doctrine §8.2): completion claims are valid only with applicable gate identities, the exact scene/cut set, stage scope, existing evidence files, bound revisions, and detector measurements. `revise`, `blocked`, missing evidence, or required `not_measured` can NEVER become completion; a mechanical gate failure is `blocked`, never "PASS WITH WARNINGS". Dependency freeze (§8.3): any mutation of frozen inputs invalidates dependent verdicts and renders — re-review/re-render, never reuse stale verdicts; after re-TTS run `tools/audio/refresh_manifest.py` and re-lock cuts. Legacy compat (§8.4): a historical/legacy mode (explicitly declared `validation_mode="legacy"`) can never silently authorize new production — strict is the default. Publication separation (§8.4): render acceptance (QC PASS) authorizes nothing beyond the accepted render; publish/delivery requires its own explicit owner authorization.
